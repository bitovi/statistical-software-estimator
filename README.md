# Statistical Software Estimator

This tool provides more accurate software estimates. For the theory behind it, read [Why software projects take longer than you think: a statistical model](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html).

Instead of modeling estimates with one value (the estimate), this tool lets you model estimates with probabilities, specifically a [log normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) that more accurately models how software development times actually turn out.
